# Python-Practice
Hey my name is Dat Phan! This repository that you see here is for me and also for you if you encounter this repository a way to practice or refresh old Python skills. Think of it as a neat dictionary or a "Ohhhh" or "Ah-Hah!". A great resource if it's been awhile and to show progress throughout the commits and dedication of expanding knowledge and aptitude for passion of learning! Fun little fact is that Python is my first ever coding language I learned!
