# 4 types of data collection types in python
# List: ordered and changeable(modifiable) values into a collection data type, it allows duplicate members
# Tuple: same thing as a list however it is unchangeable or unmodifiable(immutable)
# Set: a unordered, un-indexed and unmodifiable
# Dictionary: unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members

# These data collection types are used and referred to store values in large scale to be used again and again. Say for example hundreds of thousands of employees information in a data base to be used.

empty_list = list() # no item in the list
print(len(empty_list)) # 0
