# Ex.
# Slicing Python strings
language = 'Python'
first_three = language[0:3] # starts at zero index and up to 3 but not include 3
print(first_three) #Pyt
last_three = language[3:6]
print(last_three) # hon
# Another way
last_three = language[-3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
last_three = language[3:]
print(last_three)   # hon




# Practice

fruit = "banana"
slicing_fruit = fruit[0:2]
print('I sliced the banana into', slicing_fruit)
