# def function
# the define function is reusable block of code, like a mathematical equation you always refer back or reuse every time
# You first define it then call it

def pets (): #have this colon
    print('I love my dog!')
    #Run your code
    #Make sure to indent

# then you call the function to run
pets()

# Rules for naming functions

# No starting with NUMBERS
# No special characters except _
